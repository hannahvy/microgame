# microgame
Creating a microgame in Unity for the first time.

# Intro
## Who I Am
My name is Hannah and I'm interested in programming, particularly game & mobile development, as well as UI/UX design.

## Programming Experience
I have past programming experience with various languages, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and R. However, I never had the opportunity to explore game development software (Unity), so I hope to learn a lot from this project.
